Ãžis file defines the file format of a playlist for radio-player.

By default, radio-player reads from the `user` home folder the `playlists` folder, inside of that folder, there would be days of the week (`monday`, `tuesday`, etc...), inside of these folders, there would be four day sections:
- late_night (0-5)
- morning (5-11)
- day (11-19)
- night (19-0)

The logic defined above is included in the advisor module

In other cases, radio player can be started with a `list` argument, where the syntax is defined in the script itself

The playlist file format itself, this is a list of files or other playlist files (imports)
The files are parsed with glob, thus you can add such entries as `/home/user/mixes/*.m4a`
Each lines starting with `@` is taken as a import, meaning after the `@` a file path to a text file with the same format is expected (yes, you can import in imports too)
Lines which start with `;` are considered comments and will not be processed
Lines containing `|` will be split into two parts, the first part will be treated as the file itself, and the argument part will be treated as arguments for that file, if the file name is empty then those arguments will be treated as global
The arguments shall have a `a=b` format, multiple arguments are seperated with a `;`, example: `a=b;c=d`
