Modules in the radioPlayer are quite simple.

First of all, ther are in total only 4 modules:
- Observer (PlayerModule), this module is a passive observer, you can use this as a status api or to send the song metadata to your RDS encoder
- Modifier (PlaylistModifierModule), module which intercepts the playlist before playing and replaced it, this module can shuffle the playlist, insert jingles or intros and outros
- (!) Advisor (PlaylistAdvisor), this module is very important and is required to run and there can be only one of these in a core session. It is responsible for picking the playlist file itself as in a file path. This can be a scheduler, or just a constant
- Active modifier (ActiveModifier), this module is optional, but there can still be only one. This module can replace the track while playing, allowing you to skip tracks or play tracks on demand, it can also extend the playlist

```

Each module shall have a python script in the modules directory. Each of the modules need to define one or more global variables in order to be seen by the core:
- module (list['PlayerModule'] or 'PlayerModule'), this shall be just the list or one passive observer class
- playlistmod ('PlaylistModifierModule', list['PlaylistModifierModule'], tuple['PlaylistModifierModule' | list['PlaylistModifierModule'], int]), module itself, list of modules or the module itself and list of them with an index integer which sets the order of modifiers (0 is first)
- advisor ('PlaylistAdvisor')
- activemod ('ActiveModifier')
